Subject: Feedback Request: Array Manipulation & UI Transition Improvements

Hi Team,

As you’re aware, I’m currently in the process of transitioning the old Nish UI to the next-gen UI. During this migration, I’ve encountered some complex logic related to array manipulation, filtering, and sorting in the frontend.

Rather than copying over the existing implementation, I’ve opted to simplify this logic using Lodash in the next-gen version to improve readability and maintainability.

I’ve documented the changes and approaches in a shared document. Please feel free to review it and share your feedback or suggestions.

Thank you!
