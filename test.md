Subject: Feedback Request: Array Manipulation & UI Transition Improvements

Hi Team,

As you’re aware, I’m currently in the process of transitioning the old Nish UI to the next-gen UI. During this migration, I’ve encountered some complex logic related to array manipulation, filtering, and sorting in the frontend.

Rather than copying over the existing implementation, I’ve opted to simplify this logic using Lodash in the next-gen version to improve readability and maintainability.

I’ve documented the changes and approaches in a shared document. Please feel free to review it and share your feedback or suggestions.

Thank you!




Subject: Request for Feedback on Array Handling Improvements in Next-Gen UI

Hi Team,

As part of the transition from the old Nish UI to the next-gen UI, I’ve come across some complex array manipulation, filtering, and sorting logic in the frontend.

Instead of copying the existing code, I’ve refactored these parts using Lodash to improve clarity and reduce complexity.

I’ve documented the new approach in a shared doc. Please take a moment to review it and share your feedback.

Thanks in advance!

Best,
