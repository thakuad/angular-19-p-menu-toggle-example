Subject: Quick Review – Two Decision Logs

Hey team,

I’ve written up two quick decision logs I’d like us to review together. They’re both pretty similar — mainly focused on simplifying our code by using Lodash more consistently and streamlining our import paths (e.g., changing ../../something/something2.ts to @/files/something/...).

Let’s go through them together so we can all agree and stay aligned moving forward.
